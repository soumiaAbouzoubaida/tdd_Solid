1a [you are taking the exam] - please Fork the repo, work on your fork.
1b [you are benching the exercise] - up to you but feel free to create your own branch to host your solution :D
2 - Start by satisfying the RaceTest, then the BattleTest.
3 - Do commit & push each time a new test becomes green.

You're not allowed to change a single character of the tests

Good luck.
